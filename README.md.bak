# README #

**Introduction**
I was provided with the following [URL](https://bitbucket.org/simonpb/toy-robot-challenge/wiki/Home) containing source code and asked to undertake the challenge. 
Based on what was provided, I have made the assumption that my task is to implement my own solution based on the ToyRobotChallenge project being a library.
My implementation, titled TRC_ALEX_MVC was developed using traditional .NET MVC with views and custom JavaScript. 

**Instructions**
To run this solution just build and play using VS and Google Chrome. From the home page, select the desired test file, switch to the Commands tab and then using 
the step button, step through each command. To reset the board, press the reset button.

**Additional Notes**
Please note the solution has only been tested on a Windows desktop running Chrome. In a normal scenario I would structure the JavaScript code differently but to 
simplify readibility I have embedded it within the home/index view.
