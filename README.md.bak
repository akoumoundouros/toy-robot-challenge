**Introduction**
I was provided with the following [URL](https://bitbucket.org/simonpb/toy-robot-challenge/wiki/Home) containing source code and asked to undertake the challenge. Based on what was provided, I have made the assumption that my task is to implement my own solution based on the ToyRobotChallenge project in the source. My implementation, titled TRC_ALEX_MVC was developed as a .NET MVC web application and using TypeScript and is intended to showcase my technical skills across a range of technologies.

**Instructions**
To run the solution simply build and run from Visual Studio and Google Chrome. From the home page, select the desired test file, switch to the Commands tab and then using the step button, step through each command. To reset the board, press the reset button.

**Additional Notes**
Please note my solution has only been tested on a Windows desktop running Chrome. Unit tests were adapted to reflect testing of the classes I created.
